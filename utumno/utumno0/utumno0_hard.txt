PoC in ptrace.c

- used ptrace to read and write to registers
    - cannot read or write to memory if no read permission
- by writing to ecx and edx on a SYS_write call, can manipulate source address and length of write
- read esp, then write values (esp-2048) > ecx and 4096 > edx
- read stack values, write down addresses of note
    - addresses of note in addresses.txt
- noticed that there were addresses that were the same as the solution in utumno0
- read that address by putting it in ecx
